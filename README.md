### Code demo

You code demo should comprise a code you have written or contributed to that you will run to show your coding skills and what was achieved, with a repo that you can share with us. The demo should be quick to run and can be quite simple. Your repo should be self sufficient, i.e. include any sample data and have a brief README outlining what the code does and how to use it, what result is expected, and if relevant any references for algorithms or research used.
